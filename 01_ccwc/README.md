Challenge Name: WC tool

Link: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc

Description: Write a program that mimics the wc (word count) utility. The program should take a filename as input and output the number of lines, words, and characters in the file.

Thoughts:
- The functionality of the tool is simple to achieve but challenging to make it efficient. Reference the wc tool of coreutils source code to understand how hard it is to make it efficient. https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/wc.c [980 lines of code]
